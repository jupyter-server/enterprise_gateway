## Overview

Jupyter Enterprise Gateway is a web server that provides headless access to Jupyter kernels within 
an enterprise.  Built directly upon Jupyter Kernel Gateway, Jupyter Enterprise Gateway leverages all 
of the Kernel Gateway functionality in addition to the following:
* Adds support for remote kernels hosted throughout the enterprise where kernels can be launched in 
the following ways:
    * Local to the Enterprise Gateway server (today's Kernel Gateway behavior)
    * On specific nodes of the cluster utilizing a round-robin algorithm
    * On nodes identified by an associated resource manager
* Provides support for Yarn Resource Management out of the box.  Others can be configured via Enterprise 
Gateway's extensible framework.
* Secure communication from the client, through the Enterprise Gateway server, to the kernels
* Multi-tenant capabilities
* Ability to associate profiles consisting of configuration settings to a kernel for a given user
* Persistent kernel sessions

documentation for a list of Jupyter Enterprise Gateway features.

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions are located in the 
[Getting Started page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html)
of the project docs. Here's a quick start using `pip`:

```bash
# install from pypi
pip install jupyter_enterprise_gateway

# show all config options
jupyter enterprisegateway --help-all

# run it with default options
jupyter enterprisegateway
```
Please check the [Configuration Options page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-options.html) 
for information about the supported options.

## System Architecture

The [System Architecture page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-architecture.html) 
includes information about Enterprise Gateway's remote kernel, process proxy, and launcher frameworks.

## Contributing

The [Contribution page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contrib.html) includes 
information about how to contribute to Enterprise Gateway along with our roadmap.  While there, you'll want to
[set up a development environment](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devinstall.html) and check out typical developer tasks.
