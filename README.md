Jupyter Enterprise Gateway enables Jupyter Notebook to launch remote kernels in a distributed cluster,
including Apache Spark managed by YARN, IBM Spectrum Conductor, Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

It provides out of the box support for the following kernels:

* Python using IPython kernel
* R using IRkernel
* Scala using Apache Toree kernel

Full Documentation for Jupyter Enterprise Gateway can be found [here](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

Jupyter Enterprise Gateway does not manage multiple Jupyter Notebook deployments, for that
you should use [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub).

## Technical Overview

Jupyter Enterprise Gateway is a web server that provides headless access to Jupyter kernels within 
an enterprise.  Inspired by Jupyter Kernel Gateway, Jupyter Enterprise Gateway provides feature parity with Kernel Gateway's [jupyter-websocket mode](https://jupyter-kernel-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/websocket-mode.html) in addition to the following:
* Adds support for remote kernels hosted throughout the enterprise where kernels can be launched in 
the following ways:
    * Local to the Enterprise Gateway server (today's Kernel Gateway behavior)
    * On specific nodes of the cluster utilizing a round-robin algorithm
    * On nodes identified by an associated resource manager
* Provides support for Apache Spark managed by YARN, IBM Spectrum Conductor, Kubernetes or Docker Swarm out of the box.   Others can be configured via Enterprise Gateway's extensible framework.
* Secure communication from the client, through the Enterprise Gateway server, to the kernels
* Multi-tenant capabilities
* Persistent kernel sessions
* Ability to associate profiles consisting of configuration settings to a kernel for a given user (see [Project Roadmap](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roadmap.html))

## Features

See [Enterprise Gateway Features](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#enterprise-gateway-features) in the 
documentation for a list of Jupyter Enterprise Gateway features.

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions are located in the 
[Getting Started page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html)
of the project docs. Here's a quick start using `pip`:

```bash
# install from pypi
pip install --upgrade jupyter_enterprise_gateway

# show all config options
jupyter enterprisegateway --help-all

# run it with default options
jupyter enterprisegateway
```

Please check the [Configuration Options page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-options.html) 
for information about the supported options.

## System Architecture

The [System Architecture page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-architecture.html) 
includes information about Enterprise Gateway's remote kernel, process proxy, and launcher frameworks.

## Contributing

The [Contribution page](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contrib.html) includes 
information about how to contribute to Enterprise Gateway along with our roadmap.  While there, you'll want to
[set up a development environment](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devinstall.html) and check out typical developer tasks.
