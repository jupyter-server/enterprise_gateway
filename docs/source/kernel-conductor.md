## IBM Spectrum Conductor

This information will be added shortly.  The configuration is similar to that of [YARN Cluster mode](kernel-yarn-cluster-mode.html) with the `ConductorClusterProcessProxy` used in place of `YARNClusterProcessProxy`.

The following sample kernelspecs are currently available on Conductor:

+ spark_R_conductor_cluster
+ spark_python_conductor_cluster
+ spark_scala_conductor_cluster
