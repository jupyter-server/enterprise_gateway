## Roadmap
We have plenty to do, now and in the future.  Here's where we're headed:

* Kernel Configuration Profile
  * Enable client to request different resource configurations for kernels (e.g. small, medium, large)
  * Profiles should be defined by Administrators and enabled for users and/or groups.
* Administration UI
  * Dashboard with running kernels
  * Lifecycle management
  * Time running, stop/kill, Profile Management, etc
* Support for other resource managers
  * Kubernetes
  * Platform Conductor
* User Environments
* High Availability
* Batch REST API

We'd love to hear any other use cases you might have and look forward to your contributions to Jupyter Enterprise Gateway.
