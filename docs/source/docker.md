## Docker Images

The project produces three docker images to make both testing and general usage easier:
1. elyra/demo-base
1. elyra/enterprise-gateway-demo
1. elyra/nb2kg

All images can be pulled from docker hub's [elyra organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/elyra/) and their docker files can be found in the github repository in the appropriate directory of [etc/docker](https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/tree/master/etc/docker).

Local images can also be built via `make docker-images`.

### elyra/demo-base

The [elyra/demo-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/demo-base/) image is considered the base image upon which [elyra/enterprise-gateway-demo](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/enterprise-gateway-demo/) is built.  It consist of a Hadoop (YARN) installation that includes Spark, Java, miniconda and various kernel installations.

The primary use of this image is to quickly build elyra/enterprise-gateway images for testing and development purposes.  To build a local image, run `make demo-base`.

As of the 0.9.0 release, this image can be used to start a separate YARN cluster that, when combined with another instance of elyra/enterprise-gateway can better demonstrate remote kernel functionality.

### elyra/enterprise-gateway-demo

Built on [elyra/demo-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/demo-base/), [elyra/enterprise-gateway-demo](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/enterprise-gateway-demo/) also includes the various example kernelspecs contained in the repository.

By default, this container will start with enterprise gateway running as a service user named `jovyan`.  This user is enabled for `sudo` so that it can emulate other users where necessary.  Other users included in this image are `elyra`, `bob` and `alice` (names commonly used in security-based examples).

We plan on producing one image per release to the [enterprise-gateway-demo docker repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/enterprise-gateway-demo/) where the image's tag reflects the corresponding release. 

To build a local image, run `make docker-image-enterprise-gateway-demo`.  Because this is a development build, the tag for this image will reflect the value of the VERSION variable in the root Makefile (e.g. 2.0.0.dev0).

### elyra/nb2kg

Image [elyra/nb2kg](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/nb2kg/) is a simple image built on [jupyterhub/k8s-singleuser-sample](https://hub.docker.com/r/https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyterhub/k8s-singleuser-sample/) along with the latest release of [NB2KG](https://github.com/jupyter/nb2kg).  The image also sets some of the new variables that pertain to enterprise gateway (e.g., `KG_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, `KG_HTTP_USER`, `KERNEL_USERNAME`, etc.).

To build a local image, run `make docker-image-nb2kg`.  Because this is a development build, the tag for this image will reflect the value of the VERSION variable in the root Makefile (e.g. 2.0.0.dev0).

## Runtime Images
The following sections describe the docker images used within Kubernetes and Docker Swarm environments - all of which can be pulled from the [Enterprise Gateway organization](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/) on dockerhub.

### elyra/enterprise-gateway
The primary image for Kubernetes and Docker Swarm support, [elyra/enterprise-gateway](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/enterprise-gateway/) contains the Enterprise Gateway server software and default kernelspec files.  For Kubernetes it is deployed using the [enterprise-gateway.yaml](https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/blob/master/etc/kubernetes/enterprise-gateway.yaml) file.  For Docker Swarm, deployment can be accomplished using [enterprise-gateway-swarm.sh](https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/blob/master/etc/docker/enterprise-gateway-swarm.sh) although we should convert this to a docker compose yaml file at some point.

We recommend that a persistent/mounted volume be used so that the kernelspec files can be accessed outside of the container since we've found those to require post-deployment modifications from time to time.

### elyra/kernel-py
Image [elyra/kernel-py](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/kernel-py/) contains the IPython kernel.  It is currently built on the [jupyter/scipy-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook) image with additional support necessary for remote operation.

### elyra/kernel-spark-py
Image [elyra/kernel-spark-py](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/kernel-spark-py/) also contains the IPython kernel but is built on [elyra/spark-py](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/spark-py) which is, itself, built using the scripts provided by the Spark 2.4 distribution for use in Kubernetes clusters. Please note that the ability to use the kernel within Spark within a Docker Swarm configuration probably won't yield the expected results. 

### elyra/kernel-tf-py
Image [elyra/kernel-tf-py](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/kernel-tf-py/) is built on the Tensorflow image (`tensorflow/tensorflow:1.9.0-py3`) and is solely a *vanilla* kernel in the sense that it does not support Spark context creation.  As noted in the image name, its language is Python and uses the IPython kernel within.

### elyra/kernel-tf-gpu-py
Image [elyra/kernel-tf-gpu-py](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/kernel-tf-gpu-py/) is built on the Tensorflow image (`tensorflow/tensorflow:1.9.0-gpu-py3`) and, like its sibling image, does not support Spark context creation.  Unique to this image, on the other hand, is the fact that it can support GPUs.  As noted in the image name, its language is Python and uses the IPython kernel within.

### elyra/kernel-scala
Image [elyra/kernel-scala](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/kernel-scala/) contains the Scala (Apache Toree) kernel and is built on [elyra/spark](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/spark) which is, itself, built using the scripts provided by the Spark 2.4 distribution for use in Kubernetes clusters. As a result, the ability to use the kernel within Spark within a Docker Swarm configuration probably won't yield the expected results. 

Since Toree is currently tied to Spark, creation of a *vanilla* mode Scala kernel is not high on our current set of priorities.

### elyra/kernel-r
Image [elyra/kernel-r](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/kernel-r/) contains the IRKernel and is currently built on the [jupyter/r-notebook/](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/r-notebook/) image.

### elyra/kernel-spark-r
Image [elyra/kernel-spark-r](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/kernel-spark-r/) also contains the IRKernel but is built on [elyra/spark-r](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/spark-r) which is, itself, built using the scripts provided by the Spark 2.4 distribution for use in Kubernetes clusters.

## Custom Kernel Images
This section presents information needed for how a custom kernel image could be built for your own uses.  This is typically necessary if one desires a completely different set of supporting libraries and chooses not to extend any of the above images.

Most of what is presented assumes the base image for your custom image is derived from the [Jupyter Docker-stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks) repository.  As a result, it's good to cover what makes up those assumptions so you can build your own image independently from the docker-stacks repository.

#### About Jupyter Docker-stacks Images

All of the images produced from the docker-stacks repository come with a certain user configured.  This user is named `jovyan` and is mapped to a user id (UID) of `1000` and a group id (GID) of `100` - named `users`.

The various startup scripts and commands typically reside in `/usr/local/bin` and we recommend trying to adhere to that policy. 

The base jupyter image, upon which most all images from docker-stacks are built, also contains a `fix-permissions` script that is responsible for _gracefully_ adjusting permissions based on its given parameters.  By only changing the necessary permissions, use of this script minimizes the size of the docker layer in which that command is invoked durnig the build of the docker image.


#### Requirements for Custom Images
Custom kernel images require some support files from the Enterprise Gateway repository.  These are packaged into a tar file for each release starting in `2.0.0`.  This tar file (named `jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernel_image_files-VERSION.tar.gz`) is essentially composed of two files (per kernel type) - a bootstrap script and a kernel launcher.

##### Bootstrap-kernel.sh
Enterprise Gateway provides a single [bootstrap-kernel.sh](https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/blob/master/etc/kernel-launchers/bootstrap/bootstrap-kernel.sh) script that handles the three kernel languages supported out of the box - Python, R, and Scala.  When a kernel image is started by Enterprise Gateway, parameters used within the bootstrap-kernel.sh script are conveyed via environment variables.  The bootstrap script is then responsible for validating and converting those parameters to meaningful arguments to the appropriate launcher.

##### Kernel Launcher
The kernel launcher, as discussed [here](system-architecture.html#kernel-launchers) does a number of things.  In paricular, it creates the connection ports and conveys that connection information back to Enterprise Gateway via the socket identified by the response address parameter.  Although not a requirement for container-based usage, it is recommended that the launcher be written in the same language as the kernel.  (This is more of a requirement when used in applications like YARN.)

#### Sample Dockerfile for Custom Kernel Image
Here's an example Dockerfile that installs the minimally necessary items for a python-based kernel image.  Note that it assumes the base (FROM) image is from juptyer/docker-stacks.  If your base image is not from docker-stacks, it is recommended that you NOT run the image as USER `root` and create an _image user_ that is not UID 0.  (Enterprise Gateway makes no assumption relative to the user in which the kernel image is running.) 

You can reference the [kernel-spark-py Dockerfile](https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/blob/master/etc/docker/kernel-spark-py/Dockerfile) (among others) for an example for an image not derived from docker-stacks - although these copy the bootstrap and launcher files directly from the build directory rather than using the `wget` command to pull from the git repository.

```dockerfile
# Choose a base image.  Preferrably one from https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks
FROM jupyter/scipy-notebook:61d8aaedaeaf
  
# Install any packages required for the kernel-wrapper.  If the image
# does not contain the target kernel (i.e., IPython, IRkernel, etc.,
# it should be installed as well.
RUN pip install pycrypto

# Switch user to root since, if from docker-stacks, its probably jovyan
USER root

# Download and extract the enterprise gateway kernel launchers and bootstrap 
# files and deploy to /usr/local/bin. Change permissions to NB_UID:NB_GID.
RUN wget https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/releases/download/v2.0.0/jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernel_image_files-2.0.0.tar.gz &&\
        tar -xvf jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernel_image_files-2.0.0.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin &&\
        rm -f jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernel_image_files-2.0.0.tar.gz &&\
        fix-permissions /usr/local/bin

# Switch user back to jovyan and setup language and default CMD
USER $NB_UID
ENV KERNEL_LANGUAGE python
CMD /usr/local/bin/bootstrap-kernel.sh
```
