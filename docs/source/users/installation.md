# Installing the client

In terms of Enterprise Gateway, the client application is typically Jupyter Server (hosting JupyterLab) or Jupyter Notebook. These applications are then configured to connect to Enterprise Gateway.

To install Jupyter Server via `pip`:

```bash
pip install jupyter_server
```

or via `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_server
```

Likewise, for Jupyter Notebook via `pip`:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

or via `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
```
