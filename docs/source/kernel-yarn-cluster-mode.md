## YARN Cluster Mode

To leverage the full distributed capabilities of Jupyter Enterprise Gateway, there is a need to provide additional configuration options in a cluster deployment.

The following sample kernelspecs are currently available on YARN cluster:

+ spark_R_yarn_cluster
+ spark_python_yarn_client
+ spark_scala_yarn_client

The distributed capabilities are currently based on an Apache Spark cluster utilizing YARN as the Resource Manager and thus require the following environment variables to be set to facilitate the integration between Apache Spark and YARN components:

* SPARK_HOME: Must point to the Apache Spark installation path
```
SPARK_HOME:/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client                            #For HDP distribution
```
* EG_YARN_ENDPOINT: Must point to the YARN Resource Manager endpoint if remote from YARN cluster
```
EG_YARN_ENDPOINT=http://${YARN_RESOURCE_MANAGER_FQDN}:8088/ws/v1/cluster #Common to YARN deployment
```
Note: If Enterprise Gateway is using an applicable HADOOP_CONF_DIR that contains a valid `yarn-site.xml` file, then this config value can remain unset (default = None) and the YARN client library will locate the appropriate Resource Manager from the configuration.  This is also true in cases where the YARN cluster is configured for high availability.

If Enterprise Gateway is remote from the YARN cluster (i.e., no HADOOP_CONF_DIR) and the YARN cluster is configured for high availability, then the alternate endpoint should also be specified...

```
EG_ALT_YARN_ENDPOINT=http://${ALT_YARN_RESOURCE_MANAGER_FQDN}:8088/ws/v1/cluster #Common to YARN deployment
```

### Configuring Kernels for YARN Cluster mode

For each supported Jupyter Kernel, we have provided sample kernel configurations and launchers as part of the release [jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernelspecs-2.5.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/releases/download/v2.5.0/jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernelspecs-2.5.0.tar.gz).

Considering we would like to enable the IPython Kernel that comes pre-installed with Anaconda to run on Yarn Cluster mode, we would have to copy the sample configuration folder **spark_python_yarn_cluster** to where the Jupyter kernels are installed (e.g. jupyter kernelspec list)

``` Bash
wget https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/releases/download/v2.5.0/jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernelspecs-2.5.0.tar.gz
SCALA_KERNEL_DIR="$(jupyter kernelspec list | grep -w "python3" | awk '{print $2}')"
KERNELS_FOLDER="$(dirname "${SCALA_KERNEL_DIR}")"
mkdir $KERNELS_FOLDER/spark_python_yarn_cluster/
tar -zxvf jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernelspecs-2.5.0.tar.gz --strip 1 --directory $KERNELS_FOLDER/spark_python_yarn_cluster/ spark_python_yarn_cluster/
```
  
After that, you should have a `kernel.json` that looks similar to the one below:

```json
{
  "language": "python",
  "display_name": "Spark - Python (YARN Cluster Mode)",
  "metadata": {
    "process_proxy": {
      "class_name": "enterprise_gateway.services.processproxies.yarn.YarnClusterProcessProxy"
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "SPARK_HOME": "/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client",
    "PYSPARK_PYTHON": "/opt/conda/bin/python",
    "PYTHONPATH": "${HOME}/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages:/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client/python:/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client/python/lib/py4j-0.10.6-src.zip",
    "SPARK_YARN_USER_ENV": "PYTHONUSERBASE=/home/yarn/.local,PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages:/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client/python:/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client/python/lib/py4j-0.10.6-src.zip,PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH",
    "SPARK_OPTS": "--master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --name ${KERNEL_ID:-ERROR__NO__KERNEL_ID} --conf spark.yarn.submit.waitAppCompletion=false",
    "LAUNCH_OPTS": ""
  },
  "argv": [
    "/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/spark_python_yarn_cluster/bin/run.sh",
     "--RemoteProcessProxy.kernel-id",
    "{kernel_id}",
    "--RemoteProcessProxy.response-address",
    "{response_address}",
    "--RemoteProcessProxy.public-key",
    "{public_key}"
  ]
}
```

### Scala Kernel (Apache Toree kernel)

We have tested the latest version of [Apache Toree](https://toree.apache.org/) with Scala 2.11 support.  Please note that the Apache Toree kernel is now bundled in the kernelspecs tar file for each of the Scala kernelspecs provided by Enterprise Gateway.

Follow the steps below to install/configure the Toree kernel:

**Install Apache Toree Kernelspecs**

Considering we would like to enable the Scala Kernel to run on YARN Cluster and Client mode we would have to copy the sample configuration folder **spark_scala_yarn_cluster** to where the Jupyter kernels are installed (e.g. jupyter kernelspec list)

``` Bash
wget https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/releases/download/v2.5.0/jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernelspecs-2.5.0.tar.gz
KERNELS_FOLDER=/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels
tar -zxvf jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernelspecs-2.5.0.tar.gz --strip 1 --directory $KERNELS_FOLDER/spark_scala_yarn_cluster/ spark_scala_yarn_cluster/
```

For more information about the Scala kernel, please visit the [Apache Toree](https://toree.apache.org/) page.

### Installing support for Python (IPython kernel)

The IPython kernel comes pre-installed with Anaconda and we have tested with its default version of [IPython kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

**Update the IPython Kernelspecs**

Considering we would like to enable the IPython kernel to run on YARN Cluster and Client mode we would have to copy the sample configuration folder **spark_python_yarn_cluster** to where the Jupyter kernels are installed (e.g. jupyter kernelspec list)

``` Bash
wget https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/releases/download/v2.5.0/jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernelspecs-2.5.0.tar.gz
KERNELS_FOLDER=/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels
tar -zxvf jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernelspecs-2.5.0.tar.gz --strip 1 --directory $KERNELS_FOLDER/spark_python_yarn_cluster/ spark_python_yarn_cluster/
```

For more information about the IPython kernel, please visit the [IPython kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) page.

### Installing support for R (IRkernel)

**Install IRkernel**

Perform the following steps on Jupyter Enterprise Gateway hosting system as well as all YARN workers

```Bash
conda install --yes --quiet -c r r-essentials r-irkernel r-argparse
# Create an R-script to run and install packages and update IRkernel
cat <<'EOF' > install_packages.R
install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'evaluate', 'git2r', 'crayon', 'pbdZMQ',
                   'devtools', 'uuid', 'digest', 'RCurl', 'curl', 'argparse'),
                   repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')
devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel@0.8.14')
IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)
EOF
# run the package install script
$ANACONDA_HOME/bin/Rscript install_packages.R
# OPTIONAL: check the installed R packages
ls $ANACONDA_HOME/lib/R/library
```

**Update the IRkernel Kernelspecs**

Considering we would like to enable the IRkernel to run on YARN Cluster and Client mode we would have to copy the sample configuration folder **spark_R_yarn_cluster** to where the Jupyter kernels are installed (e.g. jupyter kernelspec list)

``` Bash
wget https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway/releases/download/v2.5.0/jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernelspecs-2.5.0.tar.gz
KERNELS_FOLDER=/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels
tar -zxvf jupyter_enterprise_gateway_kernelspecs-2.5.0.tar.gz --strip 1 --directory $KERNELS_FOLDER/spark_R_yarn_cluster/ spark_R_yarn_cluster/
```

For more information about the iR kernel, please visit the [IRkernel](https://irkernel.github.io/) page.

After making any necessary adjustments such as updating SPARK_HOME or other environment specific configuration, you now should have a new Kernel available which will use Jupyter Enterprise Gateway to execute your notebook cell contents in distributed mode on a Spark/Yarn Cluster.
