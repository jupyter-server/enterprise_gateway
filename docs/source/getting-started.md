## Getting started

Jupyter Enterprise Gateway requires Python (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) and is intended
to be installed on a [Apache Spark 2.x](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) cluster.

The following Resource Managers are supported with the Jupyter Enterprise Gateway:

* Spark Standalone
* YARN Resource Manager - Client Mode
* YARN Resource Manager - Cluster Mode

The following kernels have been tested with the Jupyter Enterprise Gateway:

* Python/Apache Spark 2.x with IPython kernel
* Scala 2.11/Apache Spark 2.x with Apache Toree kernel
* R/Apache Spark 2.x with IRkernel

To support Scala kernels, [Apache Toree](https://toree.apache.org/) must be installed. To support
IPython kernels and R kernels to run in YARN containers, various packages have to be installed
on each of the YARN data nodes. The simplest way to enable all the data nodes with required
dependencies is to install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com/) on all cluster nodes.

To take full advantage of security and user impersonation capabilities, a Kerberized cluster
is recommended.

### Enterprise Gateway Features

Jupyter Enterprise Gateway exposes the following features and functionality:

* Enables the ability to launch kernels on different servers thereby distributing resource utilization 
across the enterprise
* Pluggable framework allows for support of additional resource managers
* Secure communication from client to kernel
* Persistent kernel sessions (see [Roadmap](roadmap.html#project-roadmap))
* Configuration profiles (see [Roadmap](roadmap.html#project-roadmap))
* Feature parity with [Jupyter Kernel Gateway](http://jupyter-kernel-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* A CLI for launching the enterprise gateway server: `jupyter enterprisegateway OPTIONS`
* A Python 2.7 and 3.3+ compatible implementation


### Installing Enterprise Gateway

For new users, we **highly recommend** [installing Anaconda](http://www.anaconda.com/download).
Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), the [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) and other commonly used
packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

* Download [Anaconda](http://www.anaconda.com/download). We recommend downloading Anacondaâ€™s
latest Python version (currently Python 2.7 and Python 3.6).

* Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download
page.

* Install the latest version of Jupyter Enterprise Gateway from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupyter_enterprise_gateway/0.6.0)
using `pip`(part of Anaconda) along with its dependencies.

```bash
# install using pip from pypi
pip install --upgrade jupyter_enterprise_gateway
```

```bash
# install using conda from conda forge
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_enterprise_gateway
```

At this point, the Jupyter Enterprise Gateway deployment provides local kernel support which is
fully compatible with Jupyter Kernel Gateway.

To uninstall Jupyter Enterprise Gateway...
```bash
#uninstall using pip
pip uninstall jupyter_enterprise_gateway
```

```bash
#uninstall using conda
conda uninstall jupyter_enterprise_gateway
```

### Installing Kernels

Please follow the link below to learn more specific details about how to install/configure specific
kernels with Jupyter Enterprise Gateway:

* [Installing and Configuring kernels](getting-started-kernels.md)

### Configuring Spark Resource Managers

To leverage the full distributed capabilities of Spark, Jupyter Enterprise Gateway has provided
deep integrarion with YARN resource manager. Having said that, EG also supports running in 
pseudo-distributed utilizing both YARN client or Spark Standalone modes. 

Please follow the links below to learn more specific details about how to enable/configure
the different modes: 

* [Enabling Cluster Mode support](getting-started-cluster-mode.md)
* [Enabling Client Mode/Standalone support](getting-started-client-mode.md)

### Starting Enterprise Gateway
Very few arguments are necessary to minimally start Enterprise Gateway.  The following command 
could be considered a minimal command:

```bash
jupyter enterprisegateway --ip=0.0.0.0 --port_retries=0
```

where `--ip=0.0.0.0` exposes Enterprise Gateway on the public network and `--port_retries=0` ensures
that a single instance will be started.

We recommend starting Enterprise Gateway as a background task.  As a result, you might find it best 
to create a start script to maintain options, file redirection, etc.

The following script starts Enterprise Gateway with `DEBUG` tracing enabled (default is `INFO`) and idle
kernel culling for any kernels idle for 12 hours where idle check intervals occur every minute.  The Enterprise Gateway log can then be monitored via `tail -F enterprise_gateway.log` and it can be 
stopped via `kill $(cat enterprise_gateway.pid)`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

LOG=/var/log/enterprise_gateway.log
PIDFILE=/var/run/enterprise_gateway.pid

jupyter enterprisegateway --ip=0.0.0.0 --port_retries=0 --log-level=DEBUG > $LOG 2>&1 &
if [ "$?" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo $! > $PIDFILE
else
  exit 1
fi
```

### Connecting a Notebook to Enterprise Gateway

[NB2KG](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/nb2kg) is used to connect a Notebook from a
local desktop or laptop to the Enterprise Gateway instance on the Spark/YARN cluster. We strongly recommend
that NB2KG [v0.1.0](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/nb2kg/releases/tag/v0.1.0) be used as our team has 
provided some security enhancements to enable for conveying the notebook  user (for configurations when 
Enterprise Gateway is running behind a secured gateway) and allowing for increased request  timeouts (due 
to the longer kernel startup times when interacting with the resource manager or distribution operations). 

Extending the notebook launch command listed on the [NB2KG repo](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/nb2kg#run-notebook-server), 
one might use the following...

```bash
export KG_URL=http://<ENTERPRISE_GATEWAY_HOST_IP>:8888
export KG_HTTP_USER=guest
export KG_HTTP_PASS=guest-password
export KG_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30
export KERNEL_USERNAME=${KG_HTTP_USER}
jupyter notebook \
  --NotebookApp.session_manager_class=nb2kg.managers.SessionManager \
  --NotebookApp.kernel_manager_class=nb2kg.managers.RemoteKernelManager \
  --NotebookApp.kernel_spec_manager_class=nb2kg.managers.RemoteKernelSpecManager
```

For your convenience, we have also build a docker image ([elyra/nb2kg](docker.html#elyra-nb2kg)) with 
latest Jupyter Notebook and NB2KG which can be launched by the command below:

```bash
docker run -t --rm \
  -e KG_URL='http://<master ip>:8888' \
  -e KG_HTTP_USER=guest \ 
  -e KG_HTTP_PASS=guest-password \ 
  -p 8888:8888 \
  -e VALIDATE_KG_CERT='no' \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG \
  -e KG_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=40 \
  -e KG_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=40 \
  -v ${HOME}/notebooks/:/tmp/notebooks \
  -w /tmp/notebooks \
  elyra/nb2kg
```
