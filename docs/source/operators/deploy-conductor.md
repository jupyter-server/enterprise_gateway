# IBM Spectrum Conductor deployments

This information will be added shortly. The configuration is similar to that of [Hadoop YARN deployments](deploy-yarn-cluster.md) with the `ConductorClusterProcessProxy` used in place of `YARNClusterProcessProxy`.

The following sample kernel specifications are currently available on IBM Spectrum Conductor:

- spark_R_conductor_cluster
- spark_python_conductor_cluster
- spark_scala_conductor_cluster
