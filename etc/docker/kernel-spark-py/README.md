This image enables the use of an IPython kernel launched from [Jupyter Enterprise Gateway](https://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) within a Kubernetes cluster.  It is built on the base image [elyra/kernel-py](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/kernel-py/), and adds [Apache Spark 2.4.6](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.6/).  Note: The ability to use the kernel within Spark within a Docker Swarm configuration probably won't yield the expected results.

# What it Gives You
* IPython kernel support (with debugger)
* [Data science libraries](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-scipy-notebook)
* Spark on kubernetes support from within a Jupyter Notebook

# Basic Use
Deploy [enterprise-gateway](https://hub.docker.com/r/elyra/enterprise-gateway/) per its instructions and configured to the appropriate environment.

Launch a gateway-enabled Jupyter Notebook application against  the Enterprise Gateway instance and pick the desired kernel to use in your notebook.
