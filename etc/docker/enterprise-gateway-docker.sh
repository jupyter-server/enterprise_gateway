# This file is used to deploy Enterprise Gateway as a traditional docker container.
# We should convert this to a Docker Compose file at some point.
# First a docker overlay network is created and referenced by the service.  This network
# must also get conveyed to launched kernel containers and that occurs via the env variable: EG_DOCKER_NETWORK
