Built on [aghorbani/spark:2.1.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/aghorbani/spark/) that includes
[Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) (2.7.1) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) (2.1.0), this image updates Java to 
1.8 (jdk-8u162), and adds Anaconda (4.4 with R) and [Toree](https://toree.apache.org/) (0.2.0) to act as a base image 
for [Jupyter Enterprise Gateway](http://jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
