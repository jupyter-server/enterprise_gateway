# A docker user network is created and referenced by the service.  This network
# must also get conveyed to launched kernel containers and that occurs via the env variable: EG_DOCKER_NETWORK

# Notes (FIXMEs):
# 1. We need to address the need to run as UID 0 (root).  This appears to be required inorder to create containers/services from within.
# 2. Using endpoint-mode dnsrr (which appears to be required inorder for kernel container to send the connection info response back)
# also required mode=host on any published ports. :-(
# 3. We only use one replica since session affinity is another point of investigation in Swarm
